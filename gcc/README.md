if you're on windows, you can download the i686-elf-tools-windows.zip from [here](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools/releases/) and unzip in this folder(should be like ./bin, ./lib and that)
after that you can go to the qemu folder and follow the steps there if you haven't already
if you've done that, run git bash in the project root and run `./buildtest2.sh` and it *should*
 work if you've done everything right
